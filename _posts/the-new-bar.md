I was recently watching an episode of "A Cheeky Pint" by Stripe's John Collison. This one was with Des Traynor
from Intercom. Fantastic episode by the way, and very under-watched compared to the rest of the series. About
halfway through, I thought it was interesting that these two seemed to talk as if they were peers who were in
very similar stages of growth.

My experience with founders is that because of the wide gap between different stages of companies, particularly
in the earlier stages, there is a hesitancy to engage as peers unless you are already at a similar stage +/- an
order of magnitude. Exceptions of course for mentorship.

It was for this reason that the conversation was surprising to me. It felt as if the two were peers, working
through similar problems. I assumed that Stripe was at least two orders of magnitude ahead of Intercom in size -
in my mind, Stripe was and is the shining example of extremely high growth SaaS companies, and amongst the most
valuable private companies in the world.

I decided to check that assumption, and learned that actually stripe is doing ~$5Bn in revenue annually. So
the gap is 10x, not 100x, and the conversation made much more sense to me. My gut reaction to Stripe's revenue,
though, was "that's it?"

AI companies have raised the bar for what fast growth means. It's not just that foundation model providers are
rocketing their neocloud partners into hyperscaler status - the tools built on top of these models are also
growing at the same absurd rates, particularly in the 0-$1b ARR range.

I think there are a few reasons for this that are important to understand as consumers of AI models, and as
builders of AI products.

### Not every token is equally valuable
The best cloud businesses are the ones that create the most amount of value per unit of cloud resource. This
is, at first, not a useful generalization. What it meant in practice was that you are better off building a
business that solved an incredibly valuable problem. That should be self-obvious for founders. However, compute
utility vs cost has been mostly maxxed out from a SaaS perspective, at least to a point where it doesn't matter
anymore. SaaS margins don't tend to get much better when the next generation of CPUs launch, but that definitely
did happen in the early days.

Unsurprisingly, tokens have become the commodity of AI products, in a similar capacity to vCPUs and RAM in
the cloud, but we are in the early days! The cost of a token is declining while the utility is rising, with
both of these happening incredibly quickly in lockstep. This causes products to be evaluated in two ways: as
commodities, or as valuable services.

You want your product to be a service, not a commodity. If it's a commodity, you are never going to benefit from
the lock-step of the utility and cost of a token. Instead, you just get some distribution margin (see: Cursor,
Windsurf, etc.). If you are viewed as a service, the value you provide is fundamentally disconnected from the
price of a token, and instead relies on its utility. Preferrably, you can find a way to price your service in a
usage or outcome-based manner so that you win twice - once on the widening utility-cost ratio, and once on your
customers growing thanks to your product.

... To be continued. This post is a draft.
