Hey there, future visitor! If you're reading this, it is most definitely after I decided to publish (or commit, rather), which means you, my friend, are from the future. How impressive!

I am not entirely sure what (or how frequently) I will post here, but for now I've kept it simple. Thanks [gh/Tsai002](https://github.com/Tsai002) for this [minimal (and fast) theme](https://github.com/Tsai002/nodep). If anyone is interested in the infra, I have hosted this using [CloudFlare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

Anyway, that's all for now. Just wanted to write a quick post introducing this site/blog! More to come hopefully.
